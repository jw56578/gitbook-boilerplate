## Prep For Your Career: TASKorHABITtoCREATE-->

<!-- ### Why it's Important -->
<!-- This section is meant to develop our student soft-skills or daily routine to make them more value to future employers. Things like books to read, apps to build, youTubers to follow, learning habits, agile approaches, etc. This is where we give them a background to the history or common practice in the industry. We must remember they have no idea how the tech world works and many haven't had a professional job before. -->

<!-- Give them the why behind the ACTION ITEM they're about to do. -->

<!-- ### Action Item -->
<!-- This is a specific task they can do NOW. It needs to be small and make them feel they are actually contributing to the their career, LinkedIn profile update, follow people on Medium, youTube, GitHub, Reddit, Hackernews, etc...  -->
<!-- Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem Ipsum Lorem -->

<!-- ## Hear it from a Grad - TOPIC -->

<!-- ### Question: The question...? -->

<!-- As we develop our curriculum, we not only want to teach hard-skills but also soft-skill and confidence. We connect with humans and the more we use our graduates to support current students the more successful they should be in the future. As ACA grows, we should include a short video clip of a grad being asked a question about the TOPIC. This will bring to the student context to the what their doing and why its important. Again, always instilling confidence!! -->
