text editor, and a terminal, or terminal emulator (a.k.a. Command Line Interface(CLI)).\nRead It - Prepare Your Machine\n\n\nSure you can surf with Internet Explore, Edge, Opera, Firefox or Safari but Chrome has undoubtedly the strongest built in devTools of all browsers. Be sure to download Chrome so you give yourself the best advantage possible and start reading up on its power.\n\nA text editor is just that, a text editor. It is used to edit and contain your code into files before they are executed. There are plenty text editors or IDEs including Atom, SublimeText, IntelliJ, Brackets, WebStorm, VIM, TextWrangler, RubyMine and even NotePad. Some are paid, others are free but for our use-case and to get the most powerful text editor for the buck we're going to use the free and well supported Visual Studio Code. Be sure to download it and then read up on other text editors as you grow as a developer. \n\nThink of the terminal or CLI(Command-Line Interface) as a short-cut to the computer. Normally we access our computer's programs and files through a GUI(Graphical User Interface(pronounced: \"gooey\")). This way is nice and pretty but sometimes we need to access the computer more directly and make it work faster. We can do this using the Command-Line.\n\nIf you are using a macOS you have a built in terminal, simply hold command + spacebar then type in \"terminal\" + enter.\nIf you are using a Windows machine pre-Windows 10 then you will need to download gitBash to work as your terminal emulator. See: Chocolatey.\nIf you are using a Windows machine with Windows 10+ then you can use the build-in Command Prompt.\n\n\nWe will use these terminals or terminal emulators later in the course. For now, just make sure you have them. \n\nSee It - Prepare Your Machine\n\n\n\nGo to Pre-Work Step 2 >\n© 2019 Lubbock Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n -->\n© 2019 Austin Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n\n"},"preCourseWork/codeSandBoxes-Prep.html":{"url":"preCourseWork/codeSandBoxes-Prep.html","title":"Step 2 Code Sandboxes","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n  Austin Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  Lubbock Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  \n    Austin\n    Coding Academy\n  \n\n\n\nStep 2 - Playing with code in a sandbox!\n\nRead It\n\nCode sandboxes are really useful tool to share ideas, play with possibilities and explore new ideas without the pressures of building your file structure, setting up your machine or depending on the console. In class we'll use CodePen to share snippets of code, give you a place to practice and find new things. Get in the habit of browsing and playing with CodePens as you work through the textbook. Its where \"the rubber meets the road\", so to speak. CodePens are where you actually get to apply the concepts you just read or watched about PLUS, you will frequently use them in your new career.\nThere are plenty of sandboxes to play in. Repl.it, JSBin, CodeSandBox, JSFiddle and more! Get dirty and explore for yourself!\nSee It\n\n\nFor now checkout this cool codepen and explore the CodePen Community.\n\nSee the Pen SVG Animation - Island project by Issey (@issey) on CodePen.\n\n\nPractice It\n\n\nGo sign-up for an account now!\n\nGo to Pre-Work Step 3 >\n© 2019 Lubbock Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n -->\n© 2019 Austin Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n\n"},"preCourseWork/flippedClassroom-Prep.html":{"url":"preCourseWork/flippedClassroom-Prep.html","title":"Step 3 Flipped Classroom","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n  Austin Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  Lubbock Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  \n    Austin\n    Coding Academy\n  \n\n\n\nStep 3 - Learning in a Flipped Classroom\n\nLearning in a differently styled classroom than the one you're used to can be a hard adjustment for some. Read through and learn what adjustments you need to make in your mind about a Flipped Classroom approach.\nRead It - Learning in a Flipped Classroom\n\nIn the traditional classroom, the teacher is the central focus of a lesson. The teacher responds to questions while students defer directly to the teacher for guidance and feedback. In a classroom with a traditional style of instruction, individual lessons may be focused on an explanation of content utilizing a lecture-style. Typically, this pattern of teaching also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practicing a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school.\nIn a Flipped Classroom students are required to study the content of the lecture outside of class by reading, watching videos and fiddling with code. Class time with the instructor is then mostly reserved to questions over the content, small discussions of related topics and then dedicated guided practice time on each project. This way students get access to a professional programmer when they need it, during problems and struggles.\nThis approach may feel difficult at first but this methodology has been proven to work and is well suited for both adult learners and part-time education.\nSee It - Learning in a Flipped Classroom\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice It - Learning in a Flipped Classroom\n\nRead over the pre-work before each class and write down your questions and thoughts. Bring them to class. The more you do this the better you will work in class and the faster you will learn.\n\nGo to Pre-Work Step 4 >\n© 2019 Lubbock Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n -->\n© 2019 Austin Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n\n"},"preCourseWork/splat-Prep.html":{"url":"preCourseWork/splat-Prep.html","title":"Step 4 S.P.L.A.T.","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n  Austin Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  Lubbock Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  \n    Austin\n    Coding Academy\n  \n\n\n\nThe S.P.L.A.T. Method\nAs you journey through the world of web development, you will find that you have dedicated yourself to a lifetime of learning. All developers, all day, are researching and learning about new technologies, and better solutions to their problems. You are on track to join them in their exploration of the ever-growing wealth of knowledge in the inter-web. (And, just to be clear, there is no way to cover all of the libraries, languages, configurations and hacks out there in just 10-months!) Because of the vast landscape of development, and our limited time together, you must bring to this class, and to your personal growth, ownership. This is what we mean by a growth-mindset.\nYou must own your learning, your growth, and your curiosity. To help you do this, we will not only be teaching you how to code, program, and develop, but also how to learn, and how to teach yourself new skills to expand your abilities. One of the many skills we'll help you build is \"Googling\". It may sound funny, but searching the web effectively really is one of the most powerful skills you can nurture. \nAs you google you might come across a wonderful, though frequently challenging, website called Stack Overflow. Stack Overflow is a great resource for the seasoned developer; but for a new coder it can seem intimidating and confusing. To help you learn how better to Google and navigate Stack Overflow for solutions to your problems, we use Hack Overflow. Think of it as Stack Overflow with training wheels.\nTo access Hack Overflow, go to Campus Manager, then click on the \"Waffle Icon,\" and find the icon for Hack OverFlow.\nOnce you get there, you'll see on the left side topics broken down by courses, and because previous students have worked on the same or similar challenges, the questions they asked are likely to be similar to the ones you might ask, giving you a better chance to develop faster, and contribute to future students' progress. This is how we develop our community and knowledge: paying it forward.\nSearch. Post. Link. Ask. Teach\nS.P.L.A.T. is an acronym for our style of passing on, maintaining, and growing in-house knowledge in our ACA family, which also contributes to our online and in-class community and culture: make yourself better everyday, while making others around you better!\nIt work like this:\nAccess HackOverFlow from Campus Manager. Waffle Icon > Hack Overflow > make sure you signed in (simply ask to reset your password)\nIf you have a question, you should immediately ask yourself: “Is it on Hack Overflow?\"\n1. **SEARCH** for the question on Hack Overflow\n…if you don’t find what you’re asking for:\n2. **POST** your question as a new topic.\nMake sure you ask the question clearly, add tags, links, screenshots and in-line code (use single back-ticks for in-line code) and code blocks (three back-ticks for code blocks)\n3. **LINK** your new topic in a message on an appropriate RocketChat channel!\nThis way, people can answer the question, share it with the school, and then you and everyone else can find it faster.\n4. **ASK** your question with the linked Hack Overflow post on RocketChat,\nthen @ your instructor to answer it. (@all or @my.instructors.name)\n5. **TEACH** the solution.\nThis is the most important part. If you know a question is up, go and answer it! Also, if you learn something new, pass it on to others in the form of a Hack Overflow topic. They'll find it exactly when they need it.\n\n\n -->\nFinal Thoughts\nDon’t underestimate the power of sharing what you know; it always comes back around!\nGo to Start Your Blog>\n© 2019 Lubbock Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n -->\n© 2019 Austin Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n\n"},"preCourseWork/startYourBlog-Prep.html":{"url":"preCourseWork/startYourBlog-Prep.html","title":"Step 5 Create Your Blog","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n  Austin Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  Lubbock Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  \n    Austin\n    Coding Academy\n  \n\n\n\nStart Your Blog\n\nMany benefits spring from starting your own blog! To enumerate a few:\n\nestablishing and building-up your online presence\nreflecting on your own learning and engraining the value\nsharing and connecting with others\ncontributing your lessons to the community\nexpressing yourself and recording your thoughts in a place you can easily return or share with others (i.e. potential employers)\n\nIn class, we will use your blog for all of these reasons. Your blog will allow you to record your thoughts and lessons, share them with your instructor, and prepare for the rigors of developer interviews to come.\nRead On\n\nProgressing through the material and challenges set forth in this textbook will certainly teach you new skills and establish a great baseline of knowledge. However, in our limited time together we cannot cover all of the material that may come up in an interview.\nTo ensure you are constantly improving upon your skills and knowledge base as a whole, at the end of each lessson there will be a set of questions entitled: Interview Questions. The purpose of these questions is to provide you with questions pertaining to deeper topics that might not have been covered while learning the hard-skills of coding and programming or the soft-skills of presenting.\nIf you don't know the answers to these questions...PERFECT! This is your chance to learn them! You are expected and will be graded each week on your blog post that answers these questions. Use google. Search for the terms in the questions and read as much as you can find. Once you understand the terms and ideas, synthesize the answers to the questions in your weekly blog.\nThe practice of blogging every week will do countless things for you. Simply covering new material, pushing your upper-limits and converting your new ideas into words will cultivate your ability to speak about them, which will prepare you to speak about code in interviews. It will slowly yet rapidly build your knowledge of different challenges and solutions-based approaches and record them in a place for you to return to when you are preparing for interviews as a study guide...in your own words!!\nThe final reason you should be happy to be writing a weekly blog is that in order for you to move on to the next course you will need to pass the Exit Test of this course. The questions to this test are pulled from the Interview Questions you answer each week. This is a win-win for you all the way around!\nInstructions\n\nGo to Medium.com\nSign-up for a free account\nBookmark the site into your bookmarks bar\nAt the end of each class there is a set of Interview Questions for you to answer in your blog. Use the time in class to discuss the questions with your instructor but then take them home and research for yourself so you can answer them in your blog.\nRemember, you will be graded for the completion of your blog but also this will be a place you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months!\nWhen publishing your blogs, make sure you tag \"AustinCodingAcademy\", \"Coding\", and \"Web Development\" in your story.\nEvery class will end with a discussion over these questions. If you have no idea about them, ask your instructor. Nevertheless, you will need to research the topics on your own and record what you learned in a blog. You will then turn in a link with the url of the published blog in Campus Manager. Feel free to copy/paste the question into google and read about what comes up. These interview questions are meant to broaden your knowledge and cover more ground than we can possible get to in these 8 weeks. We want you to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and these the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool you need to succeed!\n\nSee It\n\n\nBe sure to have your account up and ready to start blogging on your first night of class!!\nGo to Pre-Classwork >\n© 2019 Lubbock Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n -->\n© 2019 Austin Coding Academy\n\n\n  fetch('/_book/gitbook/style.css').catch(function(error) {\n    window.location = window.location.href;\n  });\n\n"},"01Week/01DayPrep.html":{"url":"01Week/01DayPrep.html","title":"D1 Pre-HW - Subject01 + Subject02","keywords":"","body":"\n  \n  Austin Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  Lubbock Coding Academy\n -->\n\n  \n  \n    Austin\n    Coding Academy\n  \n\n\n\n\nPre-Homework - Angular Components\nInspirationalQuote\nReview and Recap\n\nWe have built our Angular project from the cli tool. Now we have to actually make something for ourselves.\n\nComponent Overview\nThe Problem\nAn industry standard approach to building web apps with all UI tools such as Rectjs, Vue and Angular is to organize code into components. Component is a term for a custom html element. We want to build our own custom elements such as . You cannot do this without a tool like Angular.\nThe Solution\nWe need to learn how to build components in Angular.\n\nSee It - Understanding components\n\n\n\n\nSee It - Making a Basic Component\n\n\n\n\nPractice It - Make a Component\n\n\nLog into stackblitz with your github account.\nGo to this stackblitz project and fork it\nFollow the exact steps as shown in the video to make your own component in Angular\nSlow down, speed up, pause, rewind and fast forward the video as necessary \nWhen complete submit the link to the pre work homework entry for PreWork_Day1_FirstComponent\n\n\nKnow Your Docs - Angular Components\n\nBe sure to reference the official documentation on Angular Components. Documentation makes software useful. All good software comes with documentation so new developers can pick it up, learn quickly, apply, and even change it if needed.\n\n\nComponent Generator\n\nLet's learn how to use software tools to help us do repetitive tasks.\n\nRead It - Component Generator\n\nAt this point, we know how to make the most basic component possible. We had to make several files and import those files into other locations. I don’t know about you, but I consider that to be a lot of work we did. The thing is, I said that this is the standard operating procedure. We do this every time we want to make a component. Well, why do we have to do this? Why can’t the computer do this for us? Luckily it can. We can use the Angular CLI tool to do all this stuff for us.\n\n\nSee It - ng generate\n\n\n\n\nPractice It - Subject2\n\n\nRun the ng new command to make a project\nRun the ng generate command to build a new component\n\n\nKnow Your Docs - ng generate\n\nBe sure to reference the official documentation on Subject2. Documentation makes software useful. All good software comes with documentation so new developers can pick it up, learn quickly, apply, and even change it if needed.\n\n\nTemplate Interpolation\n\nLet's learn how to populate our component html with dynamic data with template interpolation.\n\nRead It - Template Interpolation\n\nDo you see anything wrong with the component we have made? Hopefully you noticed that our component isn't very reusable as the html is hard coded to the same thing. If you use your component in multiple places it will show the same information. We need to be able to re use the html but make the information such as first name dynamic.\n\n\nSee It - Template Interpolation\n\n\n\n\nPractice It - Template Interpolation\n\n\nTry updating your component to use a class property\nPopulate the html template with data using interpolation\n\n\nKnow Your Docs - Subject2\n\nBe sure to reference the official documentation on Subject2.

Let's make sure we internalize these concepts by answer the questions below. We'll use these as a starting point for class discussion tomorrow. Don't rely on the Instructor or students to answer these question, DO IT FOR YOURSELF NOW. The time is now! Go google-up these on your own and have other questions to ask. We do not lecture in class, we discuss, collaborate and learn together.\n\n...\n...\n...\n\nTerminology to Know\n\nTake a look at these terms. If you don't know or can't describe any of them, take some time to teach yourself. You're a developer, which means you're also learning to develop yourself.\n\n...\n...\n...\n\nDaily Puzzle Practice\nIn class we'll work on solving problems while communicating to a group. To get better at this, (and you will), you'll have to practice on you're own everyday. YES, the first few times you work on this you're going to get stuck, frustrated, and want to give up. That's okay. Just take a breathe and take some time away from it. Ten minutes later, come back to it. Then look at the answer. Understand how it was solved and try to repeat it for yourself. In this way you can learn from REALLY smart people. Slowly, but surely, you will pick up the patterns.\nWe want you to succeed!
