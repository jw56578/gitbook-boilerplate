<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, You'll see this large chunk of comments as you develop, use them to guide you're work. A few short-cuts that will make your time move faster. Each section looks the same:

1) "Overview", "Read It", "See It", "Practice It", "Know Your Docs" if you use find/replace you can change Subject1 to the first concept and Subject2 to the next concept. You're not limited to only 2 subject so if needed, add a 3rd section.  

2) Videos in "See It" Sections should be embedded and linked to the title use find/replace to change out urls for LINKtoVIDEO1 and LINKtoVIDEO2 

3) Same for "Practice It" Sections, find/replace URLtoEXAMPLE1 or URLtoEXAMPLE2 

4) If you're linking to a blog or article please make the hyperlink descriptive not just say "for more information click [here](url)". Instead it should be, "if you want to know more about [Angular's Architecture read this article](url)."

5) In-line files and code should be marked with back-ticks `var code = "sample"`, `src/myFile.js`

6) To show large chunks of code put it inside code fences, triple back-tics with the language specified on the top line.
  csharp, typescript, css, html, javascript, ....

  ```javascript
    // use code fencing to write out code
  ```

Happy Code Teaching!

<h2 id="daily-puzzle-practice">Daily Puzzle Practice</h2>
<p>In class we&apos;ll work on solving problems while communicating to a group. To get better at this, (<em>and you will</em>), you&apos;ll have to practice on you&apos;re own everyday. YES, the first few times you work on this you&apos;re going to get stuck, frustrated, and want to give up. That&apos;s okay. Just take a breathe and take some time away from it. Ten minutes later, come back to it. Then look at the answer. Understand how it was solved and try to repeat it for yourself. In this way you can learn from <strong>REALLY</strong> smart people. Slowly, but surely, you will pick up the patterns.</p>
<p>We want you to succeed! To make sure our students are doing the right practice, <strong>everyday</strong>, for themselves we&apos;re going to give you a problem to work on here. But if you&apos;re wanting more to work on try these sites:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">HackerRank</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org" target="_blank">Geeks4Geeks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank">LeetCode</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pramp.com" target="_blank">Pramp</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, you&apos;ll want to get on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank">LeetCode</a> sooner rather than later because they actually track your progress and your profile is searchable by hiring managers and recruiters!</p>
<p>Remember to follow the rules to Whiteboarding Success:</p>
<ol>
<li>Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question</li>
<li>Write the expect return given an input</li>
<li>Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team/self</li>
<li>Test and come up with edge case scenarios</li>
<li>Revise if you can for efficiency</li>
</ol>
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, every pre-homework needs a good challenge for students to whiteboard on their own. Make sure to give them a prompt, example input and expected output -->
<blockquote>
<p>Prompt Goes Here</p>
