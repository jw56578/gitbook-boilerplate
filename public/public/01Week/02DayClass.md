<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, You'll see this large chunk of comments as you develop, use them to guide you're work. A few short-cuts that will make your time move faster. Each section looks the same:

1) Use FIND/REPLACE ALL to change "ProjectTitle" which will change the Title of the "Class Lesson", "Overview", "Example", "Instructions", "Push Yourself Further", and the "assignment due" afterwards at the bottom of the file.

2)  When listing items in Markdown use 1. 1. 1. 1. instead of 1. 2. 3. 4. This will cause you less frustration when writing "Project Instructions".

3) In the 2nd class of each week we assign blog posts to change the number of them FIND/REPLACE ALL: LEVEL08 to 108, 208, 308, 408, etc.

4) If you're linking to a blog or article please make the hyperlink descriptive not just say "for more information click [here](url)". Instead it should be, "if you want to know more about [Angular's Architecture read this article](url)."

5) In the blog REPLACE @AustinCodingAcademy with what ever school it is.

Happy Code Teaching!

# Class Lesson - ProjectTitle

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Don't worry about this line. Your Project Manager will replace it with a quote fitting for the day. -->
*InspirationalQuote*

## Student Learning Objective
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, By law we must have these objectives stated at the top of class. It also is an effective teaching method. Students with interpret these objectives and psychologically work toward these goals. Make sure ever class has the objectives of the day listed CLEARLY.  -->

*Today the student will learn and practice to understand:*

* *ObjectiveONE*
* *ObjectiveTWO*
* *ObjectiveTHREE*

## Today's Checklist
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, This checklist should be a succinct overview of what the class day will look like. It should normally include the first three items but ** also ** the major steps of the project their completing in class today. Replace listItem1, listItem2, and listItem3 with the appropriate steps. -->

1. Daily Student Presentations
1. Whiteboard Training
1. Questions for Discussion
1. listItem1

### Daily Student Presentation
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, In order to develop our students' communication skills around software development, two students will plan, practice, and teach to the class on a subject listed here. The subject may be a little obscure or only slightly related to the current topic. The second objective to these presentations is to open the minds of all the students to things we don't have enough time to cover in these short weeks with. Make suggestions for these presentation topics. -->

Today's Presentations:

  1. *TOPIC1*
  1. *TOPIC2*

### Interview Practice - Puzzle Solving with a Whiteboard
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare students for the challenges ahead we will practice white boarding in-front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The white boarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. -->

*Look, you have to solve the riddle, then you get the job. When you get the job you don't have to solve riddles anymore." - Jon*

The truth of it is that when we develop software, **most** of the work is planning, collaborating, and tasking out duties. Only a small percentage of time is spent actually coding! A lot of that planning is on the whiteboard because it's easy to erase and everyone can have a marker. If you're smart you'll plan you're in-class projects with a whiteboard and a team. And if you're really planning to be a web developer you'll need to get good with communicating your ideas on the board to a team!

To do this we'll call one student at random each day of class and they will work with the instructor on how to solve the problem/puzzle out. The rest of the class will watch attentively and try to work it out for themselves on their notebook. Follow the steps below and you won't fail **ANY** interview.

1. Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question
1. Write the expect return given an input
1. Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team/self
1. Test and come up with edge case scenarios
1. Revise if you can for efficiency

### Questions for Class Discussion
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, These questions should be copy/pasted over from the pre-homework for the class. Students are expected to research these on their own and ask clarifying question during healthy back and forth with the instructor. -->

<!-- @TODO REPLACE this line with the Questions from the Pre-homework -->

******
******

## ProjectTitle Overview
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Just like the overview in the pre-homework we want to give the students context for what they'll be practicing today. -->

Last week we covered ... and ... . You saw how ... makes ... happen.... you get the point. Give the student context for what they're about to learn now.
<!-- @TODO ^^^ Replace Example Text ^^^ -->

### Examples of ProjectTitle to Work Toward
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, A picture, mock-up, gif demo, or website the show what the students are working toward. The point is, you have experience in building apps like this and you know where they're headed. It would be more helpful if they, too, knew where they are headed. This will give the students something to reverse engineer or setup a goal post to reach. -->

* [Example 1](google.com)
<!-- @TODO link ^^^^  -->
<!-- * [Example 2](google.com) -->

### ProjectTitle Instructions

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, This section will be rather long!! Maybe 30 steps. 
1) It needs to be clear, step-by-step instructing the students how to build the app or feature we're asking them to build. Think that you want to cover an overview at the top of class then let them all work in small groups so you can just walk around the room answering questions and guiding when needed. You can do that if these steps are ** CRYSTAL CLEAR **. 
2) Remember, class time is for the students to actually code while have a professional developer there as a safety net. 
3) This will significantly help our students learn to program, problem-solve, and code.  
4) When writing these steps please ensure you're explain **why** we would do something instead of just do this, do that... -->

1. StepONEwithWHY
1. StepTWOwithWHY
1. StepTHREEwithWHY

### ProjectTitle Follow-up Video

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, This section is intended to get the students started more quickly, clarify confusion, and push them further. 

1) It must be created by the ACA/Circle Education. Instead of code-a-longs in class we give them this video.
2) Think of this video as a way for you to repeat yourself many times and any point without you actually having to say it. 
3) Also, absentee student should be able to use it to catch up.  -->

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XQu8TTBmGhA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, ^^ THIS PLACEHOLDER VIDEO BETTER BE REPLACED!!! ^^ -->

******

### Push Yourself Further - ProjectTitle

<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, Provide a challenge that uses the same skill or ask the student to figure something out for themselves. 
1) You don't have to provide step-by-step instructions; just give them specs to work towards. 
2) This is for the students that finish sooner than others and you're looking for something to give them, as well as to suggest to other students to continue practicing after each class.  -->

1. SpecONE
1. SpecTWO

## Interview Prep Blog Questions - (BlogPost_LEVEL08)
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, *Every class will end with a discussion over these questions.  Students will need to research the topics on their own and record what they learned in a blog. They will then turn in the url of the published Medium blog in Campus Manager. These interview questions are meant to broaden the student's knowledge and cover more ground than we can possibly get to in these few weeks. We want the student to be well prepared for the rigors of interviewing for development jobs and the answers to these questions will ensure that you have every tool for them to succeed!* -->

Want to get an interview? Create a web presence and prove you're interested in learning. Want to pass the technical interview? Actually be interested in learning. The questions presented in this section are pulled straight from "*[Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)*" and various online interview prep courses. If you really want to change your career and change your life you **MUST** create authentic, sincere, and original blogs that demonstrate your understanding and are titled creatively by you. It's once a week!! Get to it and get a job!!! The time is worth it and you're worth spending the time on!!

1. Discuss something you learned in class today or this week (*Can be tech related, or not.*)
1. QuestionTWO
1. QuestionTHREE
1. QuestionFOUR
1. QuestionFIVE
1. QuestionSIX
1. Title this blog something you think sums up what it's about or a theme you've seen this past week. NOT: "BlogPost_LEVEL08"!
1. **Â¡Important!** *When publishing your blogs, make sure you **@AustinCodingAcademy** and tag **#coding #programming #technology #learningtocode #webdevelopment** at the bottom of your story.*

Remember, you will be graded for the completion of your blog but also this will be a place you can return to when preparing for interviews in a few months! Spend the time once a week now on a career that's going to pay you huge dividends.

## Attendance Review
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, During the last 5 minutes of each class the Instructor will ask the students questions about what they've covered to reinforce they're learning. Draw up a few questions for the Instructor to start with.  -->

**STOP** At the end of each class we're going to verbally throw questions out for anyone to answer. In this way we can reinforce the concepts we've covered. When all questions are answered we can get the Attendance Code.

{% hidden %}
Ask the class and let student's call out the answer freely. Don't let only one student answer them all though!

1. Any questions over the blog questions?
1. QuestionTWO
1. QuestionTHREE
1. QuestionFOUR
1. QuestionFIVE
1. QuestionSIX
1. Give Attendance Code

# Instructor and Student Reminders
<!-- @TODO ATTENTION: DEVELOPER, This section is used to remind not only the instructor but also the student. The instructor needs to record EVERY class, make new assignments, and remind students about things for this class and the next one. We list those item out here. Any thing specific you need to communicate to the instructor, list it here. -->

1. **Record every class.**
1. Remind the students to merge their PRs. (*if applicable*)
1. Create an assignment called: " ProjectTitle ". Due Sunday @midnight.
1. Create an assignment called: " BlogPost_LEVEL08 ". Due Sunday @midnight.
1. Remind students to bring paper and pencils to all classes for whiteboarding.
